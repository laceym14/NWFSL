### Background

The Interactive Northwest Florida Sentinel Landscape Map was developed by Defenders of Wildlife in support of the proposed Northwest Florida Sentinel Landscape. This interactive map overlays many data layers showing the opportunities and constraints for conservation of natural and working landscapes and to protect the missions of the region's five military installations. Data from many sources were incorporated into this map including: the Florida Natural Areas Inventory, Santa Rosa County, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, West Florida Regional Planning Council, University of Florida GeoPlan Center, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, Defenders of Wildlife, Florida Forest Service.



Eglin Air Force Base, as the designated anchor military installation in northwestern Florida, is proposing to nominate the western portion of the Florida panhandle for federal designation as the Northwest Florida Sentinel Landscape. The goal of this proposal is to create an innovative partnership for collaboration and coordination among private landowners, conservationists, military installations, government agencies and others. This landscape-scale partnership could help ensure sustainability of agriculture and forestry, maintain our national defense capabilities and conserve Northwest Florida's natural resources. A [Sentinel Landscape designation](https://www.repi.mil/Large-Landscapes/Sentinel-Landscapes/) would provide its partners with greater access to funding and assistance from federal, state and local government and private sector programs to better address the complex and often conflicting demands of population growth, economic development, rural vitality, military readiness, and natural resource protection in Northwest Florida.
